				<p>The Skateboard Builder application will allow users to build their own custom skateboard from a vareity of different components. So that the user can accurately view different components, the application will have a built in 3D viewer that allows you to rotate the selected part. After selecting the parts, the application will put together the skateboard and allow you to view that in 3D also. This viewing mode is one of the applications main selling points and unique features.</p>
				
				<p>The application will support the purchasing of all the components so that the user can then built it in real life. After the user has designed their skateboard, they can save it. This allows them to open it later or design multiple before choosing to purchase one.</p>
				<p>The Skateboard builder app should provide the user the following functionalities:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Save Skateboard Designs</li>
					<li>Open SkatebBoards Designs</li>
					<li>Design a skateboard</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Select Deck Design</li>
						<li>Select Trucks</li>
						<li>Select Wheels</li>
						<li>Select Griptape</li>
						<li>Select Bearings</li>
					</ul>
					<li>View the design in 3D</li>
					<li>View individual components in 3D</li>
					<li>View Part Summary</li>
					<li>Order parts</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The SkateboardBuilder application is primarily focused on one user base: skaters. The app will be a great place for people knew to skating to learn the different components and create there first board. Skaters can use this application to create their perfect design as they can see how the completed build will look before they buy it or put it together (unlike a physical skate shop).</p>

				<p>The application acts as a virtual skateboarding shop (allowing users view and customise a skateboard but remotely) therefore skaters living in slightly more remote areas are the applications primary target audience. Above this, many skaters that live and rural areas and are young cannot easily travel far to get to a skate shop. This being considered, the user interface should be simple and easily navigable.</p>
				
				<p>Overall, the users of my application are likely:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Experienced skaters creating their perfect board</li>
					<li>New skaters looking to create their first board</li>
					<li>Skateboard shops to design an array of prebuilt skateboards</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The user of my application likely a teenager living in a rural area, they cannot drive which makes it much harder for them to get to a skateboard shop. Getting to one requires them to get a bus to a town that is miles away. Even if they got to the skateboard shop, they do not know what skateboard they want or the different parts they can choose – they don’t want to waste time going to the skateboard shop if they do not have a part they want or like.</p>

				<p>This is when the user downloads the skateboard builder application. It is free to download, available of Android and runs on most smartphones. This makes it a perfect candidate for the user to download. The app opens and allows the user to start creating a new skateboard design, one by one selecting different components. The deck choice is big and contains multiple different designs allowing them to find the perfect one. They can also rotate the view to make sure that the part is right.</p>
				
				<p>After the user selects all the desired components for their skateboard, they decide that they want to save it and design another to make sure they make the best purchase. After designing their second one they are extremely satisfied with the look of the skateboard design on the 3D view. They decide to purchase this one and the parts arrive within a week. They can now build their perfectly designed skateboard and use it.</p>

				<p>On this page you can find multiple mock-ups and designs that I created. The designs use colours, logos and images that will likely be different in the final application, however they give a general idea on how the application will look and feel. Also note that the products on most pages represent a 3D model on a 3D view (they are not going to be static 2D images in the application).</p>

				<h1>Critique</h1>
				<p>When looking for applications that are like mine, I only found two. They were both made by the same developer (Visual Sockets) and one was a newer and updated version of the first.</p>
				
				<p>The first application that I am going to critique is called Skate Designer. The main differences between my application design and theirs is that theirs does not have a 3D view or have real skating brand components. The application does however allow you to put stickers and text on it, however this wouldn't be a realistic expectation on purchasable components.</p>
				
				<p><b>Pros:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Stickers:</b> Stickers can be applied to the deck of the board. This is more functionality than I intended in my application. I believe that this is not a necessary or feasible feature in my application however because the user should be able to buy the parts but manufacturing the custom stickers would take longer. Implementing 3D sticker placement system would also increase the development time.</li>
					<li><b>Custom Deck Colour:</b> Being able to select any colour you would like for your deck is a feature that this application has over mine. It is a good feature that I may have to consider implementing into my own application. This feature is used in this application because the decks don’t have any designs – just colours.</li>
					<li><b>Custom Truck Colour:</b> You can select several different colours for the truck component on the skateboard. This is a feature that is good yet one I am not going to implement in my application. This is because my application will allow you to select from multiple different truck designs which will consist of different colours and models anyway.</li>
					<li><b>Custom Wheel Colour:</b> You can select several different colours for the wheel component on the skateboard. This is a good feature however I am going to keep my application more realistic by making the wheel choice limited to brands/real products. This will also help in the purchasing of the components.</li>
					<li><b>Multiple Board Shapes:</b> The application allows for multiple different board shapes. This is a fantastic feature as there are different types of skateboards that some people like to use. I personally know that a massive majority of skaters use one shape of board so to save a significant amount of development time I am only going to support one in my application.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><b>Cons:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>No 3D View:</b> There is no way to view components or the skateboard design in 3D. The design is only 2D images.</li>
					<li><b>No individual component view:</b> You cannot view individual components. This means that you cannot get a good view of each part that your design is comprised of.</li>
					<li><b>No deck designs:</b> You cannot select any textured/designed deck components which means you can only select colours and apply stickers afterwards to design your deck.</li>
					<li><b>No brand components:</b> You cannot select different components e.g. different bearings, wheels, decks or trucks. The customisation is mostly colour.</li>
					<li><b>Inability to purchase components: </b> After designing the skateboard you cannot purchase any of the components. This means you cannot build the design in real life and the app is classed as more of a game than a utility.</li>

				<p>The second application is called board designer. It is by the same developer as the first application and it is essentially an updated/upgraded version. It allows you to design on more types of boards such as snowboards, surfboards, wakeboards and skimboards. This is better than the first one because of the amount of different types of boards you can customise however the functionality in customising a skateboard remains the same. Assessed against my target audience, this upgraded version of the application is no better than the first.</p>

				<h1>Technologies</h1>
				<p>To produce my application I am going to use multiple different technologies. The list of technologies is:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Android Studio:</b> This is an IDE developed by Android developers themselves. It is one of the best for Android development because it has multiple useful built in features such as debugging on a real smartphone by connecting it to the computer using the ADB (android debug bridge). The software is built on an IntelliJ which is an existing and popular IDE. It is one of my personal favourites and I feel confident in using it for the development of this project.</li>
					<li><b>CrispinEngine:</b> This is a 2D and 3D graphics engine that I created in my personal time. It is built using OpenGL ES (open graphics library) and designed specifically for Android devices. The engine can import OBJ models and adding textures. It is very simple to use, and I am very familiar with how to use it (as I made it) so it is my number one choice over other engines out there. The engine is also fully documented so I can look at the code to understand how it works if necessary.  The GitHub URL for that is <a href="https://github.com/ChristianBenner/HordeSurvival/tree/master/crispinmobile">https://github.com/ChristianBenner/HordeSurvival/tree/master/crispinmobile</a>.</li>
					<li><b>Java:</b> I will write the application in Java because it is one of two programming languages that I am confident in. I am familiar with the object-oriented paradigm and believe that it is very suitable for my application. Java is also the primary Android programming language and Android Studio is very oriented around the use of it for development.</li>
					<li><b>Wavefront:</b> Wavefront is the format of OBJ file types. It is a simple and easy to use model file type that can store vertex, texture and lighting data. This is suitable for my application as the engine I am using to display 3D graphics can load this file type.</li>
					<li><b>Android SDK:</b> I will also use the built in Android SDK (software development kit) built into Android Studio. It is probable I will use the user interface libraries to select different components on the 3D view (I may use CrispinEngine user interface library instead however).</li>
