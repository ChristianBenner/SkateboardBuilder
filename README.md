# SkateboardBuilder
SkateboardBuilder is an app built using jQuery mobile and HTML. It allows you to customise and create your own Skateboard with a 3-dimensional view. You can pick from multiple different parts, textures and colours. You can even order your parts afterwards!

This GitHub contains a jQuery mobile based website that describes the goals, personas, designs and technologies of the SkateboardBuilder concept.
It is built for a university project.
