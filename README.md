# SkateboardBuilderConcept
This project hosts a jQuery/HTML based app that pitches the SkateBoard builder application concept. It is built for a university project.
The application itself is available here https://github.com/ChristianBenner/SkateboardBuilderApp.

The app will allow you to customise and create your own Skateboard with a 3-dimensional view. You can pick from multiple different parts, textures and colours. You can even order your parts afterwards!
